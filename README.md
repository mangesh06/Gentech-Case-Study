# Lean Six Sigma Case Study - Gentech

## Introduction
Gentech, a multinational company with $60 billion in annual revenue, faced an 18% revenue reduction over the last two years. In response, CEO Elliot Smith tasked the VP of supply chain operations, Grace Monroe, with initiating a Lean Six Sigma project. Led by Jeff Hugh, the project's goal was to streamline the proposal creation process and reduce cycle time by 15%. This case study outlines the steps from problem identification to solutions implementation.

## Objective
The project's primary goal was to identify and eliminate bottlenecks and inefficiencies in Gentech's proposal creation process using Lean Six Sigma methodologies. The objective was to streamline operations, reduce cycle time by approximately 20%, and generate potential revenue of $830 million per year, ultimately regaining Gentech's competitive edge.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project included multiple dimensions such as year, geography, seller, brand, month, and various timestamps for different stages of the proposal creation process. Additionally, feedback columns captured sentiments from sellers and BSS (Business Support Services), bid size, and specific issues encountered during the process.

## Methodology

### Define Phase
- **Problem Statement**: Over the past two years, Gentech experienced an 18% decline in revenue due to inefficiencies in supply chain processes and increased market competition.
- **Objective**: Enhance operational efficiency and reduce cycle times by 15%.
- **Scope**: Focus on proposal creation process.
- **Metrics**: Baseline average cycle time per contract was approximately 31.6 days.

### Measure Phase
- **Cycle Time Analysis**: The average cycle time over three years was 31.6 days, with variations by region and brand.
- **Geographical Variations**: The longest average cycle time was in North America (35.5 days), while the shortest was in Japan (27.5 days).
- **Complexity Impact**: Higher bid complexity was directly correlated with increased cycle time.

### Analyze Phase
- **Performance Metrics**: Analysis of top-performing sellers and BSS agents revealed significant insights.
- **Pareto Analysis**: Identified key feedback issues from sellers and BSS agents, including difficulties in identifying BSS agents, missing configuration details, and documentation delays.
- **Root Cause Investigation**: Utilized various tools such as Fishbone Diagrams to identify primary pain points and delays in the cycle time.

### Improve Phase
- **Recommendations**:
  1. **ERP Integration**: Ensure all proposals are processed through the ERP system, including essential contract details and automating workflows to improve cycle time by up to 0.8 days.
  2. **Sorting System**: Implement a sorting system and train employees to direct contracts efficiently, aiming for a cycle time improvement of up to 1 day.
  3. **Standardization**: Standardize templates and processes across regions to achieve consistent information and reduce cycle time by up to 1 day.
  4. **Review Process**: Standardize review processes and provide personnel training to improve efficiency, with an expected cycle time improvement of up to 1 day.
  5. **Delegation of Authority**: Delegate approval authority for contracts up to $50k to the Proposal Support Manager to expedite low-value contract approvals, improving cycle time by an additional 1.3 days.

## Conclusion
The Lean Six Sigma project at Gentech provided critical insights into the proposal creation process, identifying key areas for improvement. By implementing targeted solutions, Gentech aims to reduce cycle time by up to 5.1 days, a 16% reduction, bringing the new average cycle time to 26.5 days. This improvement is expected to decrease DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities) and enhance Sigma Level, thereby boosting Gentech's supply chain efficiency, margins, competitiveness, and market share.

## Additional Points
- **Financial Impact**: Implementing these recommendations is projected to generate significant potential revenue, enhancing Gentech's financial health.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The project underscores the importance of continuous monitoring and optimization to sustain improvements and adapt to changing market conditions.
- **Employee Training**: Training programs are essential to ensure employees are well-equipped to handle the new processes and tools effectively.
